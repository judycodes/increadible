Full Stack Application Focused on Learning & Reflection

### Getting Started
### Prerequisites

---

### [ incREADible Manual ]

#### _Enjoyed_
- Being inspired by my peers
- When the parts of the application runs and works as expected
- Implementing more exceptions

#### _Challenges_
- Microservices with Docker : Experienced errors with EntityFactoryManager when Eureka was added to my API

#### _Leadership_

#### _Mistakes/Failures_

#### _Conflicts_

#### _What would you do differently?_


---

### Built With
_Tools_
- Docker
- Postman
- DBeaver
- Figma
- Trello

_Frontend_
- React.js

_Backend_
- Java (Spring Boot)
- PostgreSQL

#### incREADible Database Structure
- Increadible's database has two data models: User & Reflection
- Reflection model has `user_id` as a foreign key for reflections related to the user

#### _Relationships_
- A `User` can have zero or more reflections.
- Each `Reflection` is associated with only one `User`.
